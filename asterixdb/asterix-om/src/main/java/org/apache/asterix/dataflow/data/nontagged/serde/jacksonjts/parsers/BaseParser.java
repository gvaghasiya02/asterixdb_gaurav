 * A base class for parsers that convert GeoJSON data into JTS Geometry objects.
 * This class provides common functionality and a shared {@link GeometryFactory} for its subclasses.
 * Subclasses of {@code BaseParser} use this shared geometry factory to construct specific types of geometries from
 * their GeoJSON representations. By extending this base class, they inherit the common functionality and the ability
 * to leverage the same geometry creation process.
